# Robotic-arm-wireless-control-via-bluetooth-app-and-voice-
My final year minor project that is to be submitted in partial fulfillment of my Bachelor of Technology in Electrical and Electronics engineering.

The working codes for my project (that I've done in a team of three) are uploaded. 
The robotic arm used is a 4 DoF "Mearm". Arduino is used as the micro-controller. It has been interfaced with a bluetooth module that pairs it with the mobile application.
4 DC motors are connected to respective joints.The connection between arduino and motors is via 2 motor drivers L293D, connecting 2 motors each.
The working video is attached as well.
